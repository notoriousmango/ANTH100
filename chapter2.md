# Why Is the Concept of Culture Important?

## How Do Anthropologists Define Culture?
Culture is not reinvented by each generation;rather, we learn it from other members of the social groups we belong to, although we may later modify this heritage in some way.

**Socialization** is theprocess of learning to live as a member of a group. This involves mastering the skills of appropriate interaction with others and learnign how to cope with the behavioral rules established by that group.

**Enculturation** refers to the cognitive challenges facing humans who live together and must come to terms with the ways of thinking and feeling considered appropriate in their respective cultures.

Human cultures also appear *patterned*; that is, related cultural beliefs and practices show up repeatedly in different areas of social life.

First, customs in one domain of culture may contradict customs in another domain, as when religion tells us to share with others and economics tells us to look out for ourselves alone.

Second, people have always borrowed cultural elements from their neighbours, and many increasingly refuse to be limited in the present by cultural practices of the past.

Ultimately, they rest on someone's judgement about how different one set of custom is from another set of customs.

A **Symbol** is something that stands for somethign else. It is our heavy dependence on symbolic learning that sets human culture apart from the apparently non-symbolic learning on which other species rely.

### Culture is...
* Learned
* shared
* Patterned
* Reconstructed and enriched
* Adaptive
* Symbolic

Culture had long been an integral part of our eolutionary heritage by the time Homo sapienses appeared some 300,000 years ago. 
## Culture, History, and Human Agency
Human beings exercise their human agency by making interpretations, formulating goals, and setting out in pursuit of those goals.

**Holism** is a perspective on the human condition that assumes that mind and body, individuals and society, and individuals and the environment interpenetrate and even define one another.

**Coevolution** approach to the human condition emphasizes that human organisms, their physical environments, and their symbolic practices codtermine one another; with the passage of time, they can also coevolve with one another. 

## Why Do Cultural Differences Matter?
What counts as an object or event in one tradition may not be recognized as such in another.

Even within a single cultural tradition, the meaning of an object or an action may differ, depending on the context.

To resolve the ambigulity, experience must be interpreted, and human beings regularly turn to their own cultural traditions in search of an interpretation that makes sense.

## Does Culture Explain Everything?
The term *Culture* has been used to describe an attribute of the human species as a whole. By contrast, the term *cultures* has been used to refer to particular, learned ways of life belonging to specific groups of human beings.

### What is Ethnocentrism
Ethnocentrism is the term anthropologists use to descrive the opinion that one's own way of life is natural or correct or even superior, indeed the only way of being fully human.
### Is It Possible to Avoid Ethnocentric Bias?
View relationships between individuals with different cultural backgrounds as not being fundamentally different from relationships between individuals with very similar cultural backgrounds.
### What Is Cultural Relativism?
**Cultural relativism** is understanding another culture in its own terms sympathetically enough that the culture appears to be a coherent and meaningful design for living.

It promotes understanding of cultural practices, particularly those that an outsider finds puzzling, incoherent, or moreally troubling
## How Can Cultural Relativity Improve Our Understanding of Controversial Cultural Practices?
### Genital Cutting, Gender, and Human Rights
When outsiders publicly condemn traditional African rituals including clitoridectomy and infibulation, their efforts may do more harm than good. 

Western woman who want to help are likely to be more effective if they pay closer attention to what the African women themselves have to say about the meaning of these customs.
### Genital Cutting as a Valued Ritual
Female genital cutting is clearly a controversial practice about which many people have already made up their minds.

Ritual was best understood as a way of socializing female fertility.

Women who become "mothers of men" are more than mere sexual partners or servants of their husbands and may attain high status, with their name remembered in village genealogies.

### Culture and Moral Reasoning
A physically dangerous precedure can appear perfectly acceptable-even indispensable-when placed in a particular context of meaning.

### Did Their Culture Make Them Do It?
People everywhere may be repelled by unfamiliar cultureal practices when they first encounter them. Sometimes when they understand these practices better, they change their minds and conclude that the practices in question are more suitable for the people who employ them raather than their own practices would be. 

### Culture Imperialism or Cultural Hybridity?
***Cultural Imperialism** is the idea that some cultures dominate others and that domination by one culture leads ineviably to the destruction of subordinated cultures and their replacement by the culture of tthose in power.

1. Cultural imperialism denies *agency* to non-Western peoples who make use of Western cultural forms, assuming that they are unable to resist anything of Western origin that is marketed to them.
2. Cultural imperialism assumes that non-Western cultural forms never move "from the rest to the West." But this is clearly false; today, non-Western music and food and meterial culture have large and eager following in western Europe and Canada.
3. Cultural imperialism ignores that cultural forms and practices sometimes move from one part of the non-Western world to other parts of the non-Western world, bypassing the West entirely.
### Cultural Hybridity
People rarely accept ideas or practices or objects from elsewhere without finding a way of reconciling them with local practices in order to serve local purposes.

### Can We Be at Home in a Global World?
**Friction** is the awkward, unequal, unstable aspects of interconnection across difference.

Friction in the struggle to bridge differences makes new things possible, and unequal encounters can lead to new arrangements of culture power. 
### The Promise of the Anthropological Perspective
The anthropological perspective forces us to question the common-sense assumptions with which we are most comfortable. It compels us to consider the cultural contexts that incluence how "scientific experts" conduct their research. 

## Chapter Summary
1. Anthropologists have argued that culture distinguishes the human condition from the condition of other living species. Human culture is learned, shared, patterned, adaptive, and symbolic. It did not emerge all at once byt evolved over time. Our biological evolution aligns with cultural influences, making our species essentially biocultural.
2. Many anthropolgists have long thought holistically about human culture. Anthropological holism argues that objects and environments interpenetrate and even define each other. Thus, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Human beings and human societies are open systems that cannot be reduced to the parts that make them up. The parts and the whole mutually defined, or codetermine, each other and coevolve. This book adopts a coevolutionary approach to human nature, human society, and the human past. Human beings depend on symbolic cultural understandings to help them resolve the ambiguities inherent in everyday human experience.
3. Anthropologists believe that ethnocentrism can be countered by a commitment to cultural relativism, an attempt to understand t he cultural underpinnings of behaviour. Cultural relativism does not require us to abandon every value our society has taught us; however, it does discourage the easy solution of refusing to consider alternatives from the outset. Cultural relativism makes moral decisions more difficult because it requires us to take many things into account before we make up our minds.
4. Human history is an essential aspect of the human story. Culture is worked out over time and passed on from one generation to the next. The cultural beliefs and practices we inherit from the past or borrow from other people in the present make some things easier for us and other things more difficult. At the same time, culture provides resources that human beings can make use of in the pursuit of their own goals. Thus, the anthropological understanding of human life recognizes the importance of human agency. 
5. Many anthropologists have criticized the use of the term *cultures* to refer to particular, learned way of life belonging to specific groups of human beings. Ctirics argue that this way of talking about culture seems to endorse a kind of oppressive cultural determinism. Supporters, however, argue that in some cases this version of the culture concept can be used to defend vulnerable social groups against exploitation and oppression by outsiders.
6. In recent years, cultural anthropologists who follow the vast contemporary population movements of migrants, refugees, and tourists have begun to study processes of cultural hybridity that cannot be reduced to forms of cultural imperialism. Rather, much of this cultural mixing appears to reflect new forms of multicultural, cosmopolitan consciousness.
