# What is Anthropology

## What is Anthropology?
**Anthropology** can be defined as the study of human nature, human sociery, human language, and the human past.  
It is a scholoarly discipline that aims to describe in the broadest possible sense what it means to be human.  
Anthropology is
* holistic - A charateristic of the anthropological perspective that describes, at the highest and most inclusive level, how anthropology tries to integrate all that is known about human beings and their  activities.
* comparative - A characteristic of the anthropological perspective that requires anthropologists to study **similarities** and **differences** across as many human societies as possible defore generalizing about human beings and their activities.
* field-based - Its data collection takes place away from the office and in direct contact with the people.  

**Evolution** is at the core of the anthropological perspective that requires anthropologists to place their observations about human beings ant their activities in a temporal framework that takes into consideration change over time.
* _Biological evolution_ - How the physical features and life processes of human beings have changed over time.
* _Cultural evolution_ - Concerns change over time in beliefs, behaviours, and material objects that shape human development and social life.

Biological evolution is not the same as cultural evolution.  

## What Is the Concept of Culture?
> **Culture** - Sets of learned behaviour, ideas, and material goods that human beings share as members of society.  

**Biocultural organisms** - Organisms whose defining features are co-determined by biological and cultural factors.  
Human biology makes culture possible; human culture makes human biological survival possible.  


## What Makes Anthropology a Cross-Disciplinary Discipline?
### Four fields
1. Biological anthropology
2. Cultural anthropology
3. Linguistic anthropology
4. Archaeology

## Biological Anthropology
> **Biological Anthropology** - The specialty of anthropology that looks at human beings as biological organisms and tries to discover what characteristics make them different from other orgamisms and whaat characteristics they share.

Some researchers developed a series of elaborate techniques to measure different observable features of human populations.  
**Races** is Social groupings that allegedly reflect biological differences.  
**Racism** - The systematic oppression of members of one or more socially defined *race* by members of another socially defined *race* that is justified in terms of the supposed inherent biological superiority of the rulers and the supposed inherent biological inferiority of those they rule.  
Some scientists believed that the races of mankind were fixed and unchanging subdivisions of humanity.  
However, that traits traditionally used to identify races did not correlate well with other physical and biological traits.  
  
**Primatology** is the study of non-human primates, the closest living relatives of human beings.  
**Paleoanthropology** is they study of human fossils and associated remains to understand our evolutionary history.  


## Cultural Anthropology
> **Cultural Anthropology** - The specialty of anthropology that shows how variation in the beliefs and behaviours of members of different human groups is shaped by sets of learned behaviours and ideas that human beings acquire as members of society-that is, by culture.

Anthropologists regularly distinguished between the biological **sex**(The physical characteristics that traditionally distinguish two kinds of humans, females and males) of an individual and the culturally shaped **gender**(The culturally constructed roles assigned to makes or females, which vary considerably from society to society)  
Cultural anthropologists collect their data during a period called fieldwork(An extended period of close involvement with the people in whose way of life anthroppologists are interested, during which anthropologists ordinarily collect most of their data).  
**Informants** work with anthropologists and provide them with insights about the local way of life.  
An **ethnography** is a systematic study and description of a particular human culture;**ethnology** is the comparative study of two or more such groups.  
All parts of the world were drawn into these processes of **globalization**: the reshaping of flocal conditions by powerful global forces on an every-intensifying scale.  


## Linguistic Anthropology
> **Linguistic Anthropology** - The specialty f anthropology concerned with the study of human languages

**Language** is the system of arbitrary vocal symbols used to encode one's experience of the world and of others.  

## Archaeology
> **Archaeology** is the specialty of anthropology that studies the human past by analyzing material remains left behind by earlier societies.

**Material Culture** - Objects created or shaped by humans and given meaning through cultural practices.  
Archaeologists focus on reconstructing our human past. 
## Applied Anthropology
> **Applied Anthropology** - The subfield of anthropology in which anthropologists use information gathered from the other anthropological specialties to solve practival cross-cultural problems.


## Medical Anthropology
> **Medical Anthropology** - The specialty of anthropology that concerns itself with human health-the factors contribute to disease of illness and the ways that human populations deal with disease or illness.

It consider the physiological and cultural variables that are involved with the perception of human health and disease, the environmental features that affect human well-being, and the way the human body adapts to various engironments.

## The Uses of Anthropology
Contact with the unfamilar can be liberating, but it can also be threatening if it undermines your condifence in the absolute truth and universal rightness of your previous understanding of the way the world works. 
It can equip you to deal with people with different cultural backgrounds in a less threatened, more tolerant manner.

## Chapter Summary
1. Anthropology aims to describe in the broadest sense what it means to be human. The anthropological perspective is holistic, comparative, and evolutionary and has relied on the concept of culture to explain the diversity of human ways of life. Human beings depends on cultural learning for successful biological survival and reproduction, which is why anthropologists consider human beings to be biocultural organisms. Anthropology is also a field-based discipline. In North America today, anthropology is considered to have four major subfields: biological anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, and linguistic anthropology; many people also consider applied anthropology to be a fifth major subfield.
2. Biological anthropoogy began as an attempt to classify all the worlds' populations into different races. By the early twentieth century, however, most anthropologists had rejected racial classigications as scientifically unjustifiable and objected to the ways in which racial classifications  were used to justify the social practice of racism. Contemporary anthropologists whoa re interested in human biology include biological anthropologists, primatologists, and paleoanthropologists.
3. Cultural anthropologists study cultural diversity in all living human societies, including their own. Linguistic anthropologists approach cultural diversity by relating varied forms of language to their cultural contexts. Both gather information through fieldwork, by participating with their informants in social activities, and by observing those activities as outsiders. They publish accounts of their research in ethnographies. 
4. Over the past quarter-century, many anthropologists and other scholars have become involved in the interdisciplinary field of scienve studies, which subjects scientific laboratories and their activities to ethnographic investigation and has shown how successful scienve in action differs from traditional idealized accounts of scientific research. Scienve studies research highlighting the productive interconnections among human beings, non-human organisms, and technical apparatus has inspired anthropologists from many subfields to revise our understanding of relationshsips between nature and culture, people and artifacts, and people and other living species. 
5. Archaeology is the cultural anthropology of the human past, with interests ranging from the earliest stone tools to twenty-first-century garbage dumps. Archaeologists focus on understanding how humans lived in the past, how past societies interacted with one another, and how cultures changed over time. Archaeologists are stewards of the human past, and they rely on historic preservation laws to protect archaeological remains from looting and destruction. 
6. Applied anthropologists, whoa re frequently referred to as practising anthropologists, oftern use information from the other anthropological specialties to solve practical cross-cultural problems. Medical anthropologiy connects biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, and applied anthropology, focusing on cultural perceptions of health and illness, suffering, and well-being.
