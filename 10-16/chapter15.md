# Why Is Understanding Human Language Important?
Human languages are very different from primate call systems. 

Humans still possess a simple, species-specific system of calls, byt because the languages we speak consist of complex symbols, our languages are distinct from call systems.

Symbolic language has made possible many human achievements, but it is a double-edged sword: it allows people to communicate with one another, but it also creates barriers to communications, espicially because not all humans speak the same language.

## What Makes Language Distinctively Human?
A number of different *design features* of human language that, in his estimation, set it apart from other forms of animal communication.
### Openness
Human language is productive. Speakers of any given language not only can create new messages but also can understand new message created by other speakers.

It also be defined as "the ability to understand the same thing from different points of view". 

No single perspective would necessarily emerge as more correct in every respect than all others.

Six calls: laughing, sobbing, screaming with fright, crying with pain, groaning and sighing

Non-human primates can communicate in rather subtle ways using channels of transmission other than voice that we consider *paralanguage*. 

### Displacement, Arbitariness, and Duality of Patterning
*Displacement*, our human ability to talk about absent or non-existent objects and past or future events as easily as we discuss our immediate situations. 

*Arbitrariness*, the fact that there is no universal, necessary link between particular linguistic sounds and particular linguistic meanings.

Arbitrariness is evident in the design feature of language known as *duality of patterning*. Human language is patterened on two different levels: sound and meaning. On the first level, the arrangement of the small set of meaningless sounds that characterize any particular language is not random but systematically patterned to create meaning-bearing units. On the second level of patterning, however, the rules of grammar allow for the arrangement and rearrangement of these single morphemes into larger units-utterances or sentences-that can express an infinite number of meanings.

### Semanticity and Prevarication
Arbitrariness shows up again in the design feature of *semanticity*-the association of linguistic signals with aspects of the social, cultural, and physical world in which the speakers live. People use language to refer to, make sense of, and talk about objects and processes in their world.Perhaps the most striking consequence of linguistic openness is the design feature *prevarication*. Not only can people use language to lie, but also utterances that seem perfectly well formed grammatically may yield nonsense.

## How Are Language and Culture Related?
**Linguistics** is the scientific study of language. 

**Lauguage** has oftern been viewed as an abstract property belonging to the human species as a while, not to be confused with the specific *languages* of groups of people. 

*Semiotics* refers to the study of meaningful signs and their use.

Three types of signs:
1. *Iconicity*. The sign looks like that which it represents
2. *Indexicality*. THe sign is causally linked to that which it signifies.
3. *Symbolism*. The sign bears no intrinsic connection to that which it represents. Symbols exhibit the design feature of arbitrariness, that is, there is no necessary link between, say, the pattern of the red maple leaf on the flag of Canada and the territorial unit for whith it stands.

### How Do People Talk about Experience?
Language are associated with concrete groups of people called *speech communities*.

We use language in ways to express various aspects of our identities, such as our profession or our family relations. For example, many businesses will use specific acronyms as a form of everyday language that allow those working in that company to communicate but that are not necessarily apparent to those not working in that company. 
## How Do We Communicate without Language?
**Non-verbal communication** - The process of sending and receiving messages without the use of workds. This is also referred to as paralanguage. We linkely communicate well over 60 per cent of our messages non-verbally, and non-verbal communication can be as effective as language in trasmitting simple messages between people. 

**Body language** - Movements and postures that communicate attitudes and deelings non-verbally.

**Kinesics** The study of body movement, gestures, and facial expressions as a form of communication.

**Proxemics** is the study of how different societies perceive and use space.

Four different inter-personal space: intimate, personal, social, and public. 
## How Do Languages Change over Time?
**Historical linguistics** is the study or relationships between languages and how they change over time.

Borrow words from the unfamiliar language and incorporate them into their own language; this phenomenon is referred to as *external* language change. There is also an *internal* changes to language and culture As cultures change new words must be invented and incorporated into the existing language to describe new technologies and experiences.
## What Does It Mean to “Learn” a Language?
**Linguistic competence** is a mastery of adult grammar

**Communicative competence** is a term coined by anthropological linguist Dell Hymes to refer to the mastery of adult rules for socially and culturally appropriate speech. Competent adult speakers are able to choose words and topics of conversation appropriate to their social position.

The study of these socially appropriate rules forms a significant part of *sociolinguistics*, which is the study of language in relation to social factors, such as differences of regional, class, and occupational dialect, power and gender differnces, and bilingualism. 

### How Does Context Affect Language?
Context influence on how people use language.

Range of dicersity present in a single language and how different varieties of a language are related to different subgroups within the speech community.

### How Does Language Affect How We See the World?
Language has the power to shape the way people see the world. THis claim is called the **Linguistic relativity principle**.

The so-called strong version of the linguistic relativity principle is also known as *linguistic determinism*.

There are a number of problems with linguistic dterminism. First of all, there are languages wush as Fulfulde in which only one third-person pronoun is used for males and females; however, male-dominant social patterns are quite evident among Fulfulde speakers. Second, if language determined thought in this way, it would be impossible to translate from one language to another or even to learn another language with a different grammatical structure. Because human beings can learn foreign languages and translate from one language to another, the strong version of the linguistic relativity principle cannot be correct. Third, even if it were possible do draw firm boundaries around speech communities, every language provides its native speakers with alternative ways of describing the world. Finally, in many societiese, people learn to speak more than one language fluently. Yet people who grow up bilingual do not also grow up unable to reconcile two contradictory views of reality. Indeed, bilingual children ordinarily benefit from knowing two languages, do nto confuse them, can switch readily from one to another, and even appear to demonstrate greater cognitive flexibility on psychological tests than do monolinguals.

### Pragmatics: How Do We Study Language in Contexts of Use?
**Pragmatics** can be defined as the study of language in the context of its use. Each context offers limitations and oppotunities concerning what we may say and how we may say it.

Two kinds of context must be considered:
1. *Linguistic context* refers to the other words, expressions, and sentences that surround the expression whose eaning we are trying to determine. 
2. *Non-linguistic context* consists of objects and activities that are present in the situation of speech at the same time we are speaking. 

**Discourse** is a stretch of speech longer than a sentence united by a common theme. 

### Ethnopragmatics
**Ethnopragmetics** is the study of language use that relies on ethnography to illuminate the ways in which speech is both constituted by and constritutive of social interaction. These studies focus on how the rules of grammar, cultural values, and physical action are all conjoined. This suggests that the source of meaning is in everyday routine social activity, or habitus, rather than in grammar and that phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and semantics are simply linguistic resources people can make use of, rather than rigid forms that determine what peeople can and cannot think or say. 

Heteroglossia is a set of coexisting linguistic norms and forms, each representing a different social subgroup. Because we all participate in more than one of these subgroups, we inevitably become fluent in many varieties of language, even if we speak only Englihs. Out  capacity for heteroglossia is an example of linguistic openness: it means that our thoughts and speech are not imprisoned in a single set of grammatical forms, as linguistic determinists argued. 

## What Happens When Languages Come into Contact with One Another?
**Pidgin** is (1) A language with no native speakers that developes in a single generation between members of communities that possess distinct native anguages. (2) A shared secondary language in a speech community in which speakers also use some other main language.
## What Is Linguistic Inequality?
pidgins turn out to be far more complext and the result of far more active human input than we used to think, which is why they are attractive to linguists and linguistic anthropologists as objects of study. 

To take one language variety as the standard against which all other varieties are measured might be described as "linguistic ethnocentrism", and such a standard may be applied to any language, not just pidgins. 

This is one kind of linguistic inequalityL making value judgeents about other people's speech in a context of dominance and suborgination. 

### What is Language Ideology?
**Language Ideollgy** is a marker of struggles betweensocial groups with different interests, revealed in what people say and how they say it. A language ideology takes one language variety as the standard against which all other varieties are measured, positively or negatively. 
## What Is Lost if a Language Dies?
Some Indigenous groups are concerned that loss of language will mean loss of access to traditional sources of religious or spiritual power, which can only be addressed in the traditional tongue. Yet other Indigenous speakers would not like to see what was once a fully functioning mode of communnication reduced to nothing but ceremonial use.
## How Are Language and Truth Connected?
Changes in scientific theories were "accompanied by a change in some of the relevant metaphors and in corresponding parts of the network of similarities through which terms attach to natture". There is no neutral language into which rival theories can be translated and subsequently evaluated as unambiguously right or wrong.

If our understanding of reality is the product of a dialectic between experience and language, then ambiguity will never be permanently removed from any of the symbolic systems that human beings invent. Much we learn about language, we will never be able to exhaust its meanings or circumscribe its rules once and for all. As long as human history continues, new forms will be created and old forms will continue to be put to new uses.
## Chapter Summary
1. Symbolic language is a uniquely human faculty that both permits us to communicate with one another and sets up barriers to communication. The anthropological study of language reveals the cultural factors that shape language use. Human symbolic language is also multifunctional, capable of performing many roles in speech events besides reference. In every language, there are many ways to communicate our experiences, and there is no absolute standard favouring one way over another. Individual efforts to create a uniqque voice are countered by pressures to negotiate a common code within a larger speech community.
2. Of Charles Hockett's design features of language, six are particularly important: openness, displacement, arbitrariness, duality or patterning, semanticity, and prevarication. Among other things, Charles Peirce's three-part theory of signs provides tools for explaining how human speakers link symbolic language to the wider world outside their hands.
3. Early linguistic anthropologists such as Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf suggested that language has the power to shape the way people see the world. This concept is called the "linguistic relativity principle". How this shaping process works is still investigated by some linguistic anthropoligists, who argue that linguistic relativity should not be confused with linguistic determinism, which they reject.
4. Enthropragmatixs locates linguistic meaning in routine practical activities, which turn grammatical features of language into resources people can use in their interactions with others. It pays attention both to the immediate context of speech and to broader contexts that are shaped by unequal social relationships and rooted in history.
5. Because linguistic meaning is rooted in practical activity, which carries the burden of meaning, different social groups engaged in different activities generate different communicative practices. The linguistic habits that are part of each set of communicative practices constitue doscourse genres. People normally command a range of discourse genres, which means that each person's linguistic knowledge is characterized by heteroglossia.
6. The study of pidgin languages is the study of the radical negotiation of new meaning. Pidggin languages exhibit many of the same linguistic features as non-pidgin languages. In colonial and postcolonial settings, the language of the colonizer is frequently viewed as superior to the language of the colonizzed. The residential school system established in Canada in the 1880s for the forced assimilation of indigenous children is an example of a dominant group's attemp to gain linguistic and cultural control over less powerful peoples in a postcolonial context.
7. Language ideologies are unwritten rules shared by members of a speech community concerning what kinds of language are valued. Language ideologies develop out of the cultural, soclial, and political histories of the groups to which they belong. Knowing the language ideology of a particular community can help linsteners make sense of speech that otherwise would seem inappropriate or incomprehensible to them. 
8. The design features of human language, particularly openness, seem to characterize human thought processes in general. The work of psychological anthropologists on human perception, cognition, and practical action overwhelmingly sustain the view that human psychological processes are open to a wide cariety of influences.
