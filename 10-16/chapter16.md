# How Do We Make Meaning?

## What Is Play?
*Openness* was defined as the ability to talk or think about the same thing in different ways and different things in the same way. If we expand openness to inclue all behaviour-that is, the ability not just to talk or think about but also to do the same thing in different ways or different things in the same way0 we begin to define **play**.

**Play** is a framing that is (1) consciously adopted by the players, (2) somehow pleasurable, and (3) systemically related to what is non-play by alluding to the non-play world and by transforming the objects, roles, actions, and relations of ends and means characteristic of the non-play world.

### What Do We Think about Play?
**Metacommunication** is a communnication about communication

**Framing**, sends a message that marks certain behaviours either as play or as ordinary life.

**Reflexivity** - Play offers us the opportunity to think about the social and cultural dimensions of the world in which we live. By suggesting that ordinary life can be understood in more than one way, play can be a way of speculating about what can be rather than about what should be or what is.

### What Are Some of the Effects of Play?
Through satire and clowning, may allow children to comment on and criticize the world of adults.


Through their imaginative and material work they were able to integrate the dolls into their own world. 
## What Is Art?
### Is There a Definition of Art?
**Art** is a play with form producting some aesthetically successful transformation-representation. *form* refers to the rules of the art game: the culturally appropriate restirctions on the way this kind of play may be organized in time and space. A *style* is a schema that is recognized within a culture as appropriate to a given medium.

By "aesthetic," we means appreciative of, or responsive to, form in art or nature.

**Transformation-representation** depend on each other. 

### "But Is It Art?"
The Division into categories of art and non-art is not universal. 

Art by intention and art by appropriation. Art by intention includes objects that were made to be art, such as Impressionist paintings. Art by appropriation, however, consists of all the other objects that "became art" because at a certain moment certain people decided that they belonged to the categoryy of art. 

To transform an object into art, it must have *exhibition value*- that is, someone must be willing to display it. 

### "She's Fake": Art and Authenticity
Unique authenticity is "the founding myth of modern concepts of authorship and copyright".

## What Is Myth?
Just as linkely to undermine the social order as to enhance it, societies tend to surround play with cultural rules, channelling it in directions that appear less destructive. Rules designed to discipline artistic expression are one result of this channelling process. A wide range or expression as long as they adhere to rules governing the form that expression takes.

**Myth** are stories that recount how various aspects of the world came to be the way they are. The power of myths comes from their ability to make life meaningful for those who accept them. 

**Doctrine** is a religious beliefs expressed throuhgh written and formal statements concerning the supernatural

Scientific stories about origins, origin myths, must be compared and tested against material evidence in the natural world; the success of this match etermines whether they are accepted or rejected By contrast, non-scientific origin myths get their virtuality from how well they match up with the social world.

### How Does Myth Reflect-and Shape-Society?
To understand myths we must understand the social context in which they are embedded. The myth contains some "self-evident" truth that explains why society is as it is and why it cannot be changed. 

### Do Myths Help Us Think
Myths are tools for overcoming logical contradictions that cannot otherwise be overcome. They are put together in anattempt to deal with the oppositionss of particular concern to a particular society at a particular moment in time. 

The complex syntax of myth works to relate those opposed pairs to one another in an attempt to overcome their contradictions. However, these contradictions can never be overcome;
## What Is Ritual?
### How Can Ritual Be Defined?
Rituals are presumed to be religious-Weddings, Jewish bar mitzvahs. Rituals also include practices such as scientific experiments;

Ritual hasfour parts
1. *Repetitive social practice* composed of a sequence of symbolic activities in the form of dance, song, speech, gestures, the manipulation of certain objects, and so forth. 
2. *set off from the social routines of everyday life*
3. *adhere to a characteristic, culturally defined schema* - Members of a culture can tell that a certain sequence of activities is a ritual even if they have never seen that particular ritual before.
4. *Closely connected to a specific set of ideas that are often encoded in myth*

### How Is Ritual Expressed in Actions?
Ritual has a *text*; Text and perfomance shape each other. 

### What Are Rites of Passage?
*Rite of passage* is a ritual that serves to ark the movement and transformation of an individual from one social position to another.

*Separation* from the old position from normal time.

*Transition* is the ritual passenger is neither in the oold life nor yet in the new one.

*Reaggregation* is the ritual passenger is reintroduced innto society in his or her new position. 

**Liminality** is the ambiguous transitional state in a rite of passage in which the person or persons undergoing the ritual are outside their ordinary social positions.

**Communitas** is an unstructured or minimally structed community of equal individuals found frequently in rites of passage. 

### How Are Play and Ritual Complementary?
Play and ritual are complementary forms of metacommunication, altough play is not real and not serious while ritual is considered important and very real. The movement from non-play to play is based on the premise of metaphor; the movement to ritual is based on the premise of literalness. 

Ritual is the most stable rigid than the play frame. Consequently, ritual is the most stable liminal domain, whereas play is the most flexible. 

**Orthopraxy** is a correct practice; the prohibition of deviation from approved forms of behaviour.

## How Are World View and Symbolic Practice Related?
**World views** is encompassing pircures of reality that contain shared political, religious, and other moral beliefs that are created by the members of societies.

### What Are Symbols?
People regularly devise symbols to organize this knowledge. These symbols represent a complex collection of ideas and feelings, which they draw our attention to all at once. et summarizing symbols oftern mean different things to different people. 

### What Is Religion?
**Religion** is ideas and preactices that postulate reality beyond that which is immediately availble to the senses.
1. *Prayer*. Where there are personified cosmic forces, there is a customary way of addressing the,, usually by speaking or chanting out loud.
2. *physiological exercise*. Many religious systems have methods for physically manipulating psychological states to induce an exstatic spiritual state. (1) drugs; (2) sensory deprivation; (3) mortification of the flesh by pain, sleeplessness, and fatigue; and (4) deprivation of food, water, or air.
3. *Exhortation*. In all religious sytems, certain people are believed to have closer relationships with the invisible powers thatn others have, and they are expected to use those relationships in the spiritual interests of others.
4. *Mana* refers to an impersonal superhuman power that is sometmimes believed to be transferable from an object that contains it to one that does not.
5. *Taboo*. Objects or people that may not be touched are taboo.
6. *Feasts*. Eaiting and drinking in a religious context is very common
7. *Sacrifice*. Giving something of value to the invisible forces or their agents is a feature of many reliigious systems.

### How Do People Communicate in Religion?
Active involvement in their lives of belings or forces that are ordinarily invisible. 

Even those who claim to have had personal experience of the reality of God, of ancestral spirits, or of witchcraft will probably still find themselves forced to resort to poetic, metaphorical language if they watnt to explain that experience to other people- and perheps even to themselves.

### How Are Religion and Social Organization Related?
Social positions are created for specialists who supervise or embody coreect religious practice.

A **Shaman** is a spritual specialist who is believed to have the power to contact invisible powers directly on behalf of individuals or groups.

A **priest** is skilled in the practice of religious rituals, which are carried out for the benefit of the group or individual members of the group.
## World Views in Operation
### Coping with Misfortune: Withcraft, Oracles, and Magic among the Azande
**Witchcraft** is the performance of magic by human beings, often through innate supernatural powers, whether or not it is intentional or self-aware.

**Oracles** is an invisible forces to which people address questions and whose responses they believe to be truthful

**Magic** is a set of beliefs and practices designed to control the visible or invisible world for specific purpose.

## Maintaining and Changing a World View
Space and place are an important part of maintaining a stable world view.
### How Do People Cope with Change?
Drastic changes in experience lead people to create new interpretations that will help them cope with the changes.

**Syncretism** is the synthesis of old religious practices with new religious practices introduced from outside, often by force

**Revitalization** is a conscious, deliberate, and organized attempt by some members of a society to create a more satisfying culture in a time of crisis.

**Nativism** is a return to the old ways; a movement whose members expect a messiah or a prophet who will bring back a lost golden age of peace, prosperity, and harmony.
## How Are World Views Used as Instruments of Power?
First, a religious symbol can be invoked as a guarantee of self-evident truths when people in power seek to eliminate or impose certain forms of conduct.

Second, a symbol may be under the direct control of a person wishing to affect the behaviour of others. 
## Why Study Anthropology?
New and different ways of life and demonstrates howo similar yet unique the human species is. Knowing and experiencing cultural variety gives rise to reflection, and, with this, we experience the ultimate understanding of our oown ultural tradition, which has been created by the generations who preceded us.
## Chapter Summary
1. Play is a generalized form of behavioural openness: the ability to think about, speak about, and do different things in the same way or the same things in different ways. Play can also be thought of as a way of organizing activities. We put a frame that consists of the message "This is play" around certain activities, therby transforming them into play. Play also permits reflexive consideration of alternative realities by setting up a separate reality and suggesting that the perspective of ordinary life is only one way to make sense of experience. The functions of play include exercise, practice for the real world, increased creativity in children, and commentary on the real world. Play is likely linked to out evolution as modern humans capable of creativity and symbolic thought.
2. Art is a kind of play that is subject to certain cultureally appropriate restictions on form and content. It aims to evoke an aesthetic response from the artist and the observer. It succeeds when the form is culturally appropriate for the content and technically perfect in its realization. Aesthetic evaluations are culturally shaped value judgements. We recognize art in other cultures because of its family resemblance to what we call art in our own culture. Although people with other cultural understandings may not have produced art by intention, we can often successfully appreciate what they hav created as art by appropriation. These issues are addressed in ethnographic studies that call into question received ideas about what counts ad "authentic" art.
3. Myths are stories whose truth seems self-evident because they do such a good job of integrating personal experiences with a wider set of assumptions about the way the world works. The power of myths comes from their ability to make life meaningful for those who accept the, .As stories, myths are the products of high verbal art. A full understanding of myth requires ethnographic background information.
4. Ritual is a repetitive social practice composed of sequences of symbolic activities, such as speech, singing, dancing, gestures, and the manipulation of certain objects. In studying ritual, we pay attention not just to the symbols but also toh= how the ritual is performed. Cultural ideas are made concrete through ritual action. Rites of passage are rituals in which members of a culture move from one position in the social structure to another. These rites are marked by periods of separation, transition, and reaggregation. During the period of transition, individuals occupy a liminal position. All those in this position frequently develop an intense comradeship and a feeling of oneness, or communitas.
5. Ritual and play are complementary. Play is based on the premise "Let us make believe," while ritual is based on the premise "Let us believe." As a result, the tirual frame is far more rigid than the play frame. Although ritual may seem overwhelming and all-powerful, individuals and groups can sometimes manipulate ritual forms to achieve non-traditional ends.
6. Anthropological studies of religion tend to focus on the social institutions and meaningful processes with which it is associated. Followers of religions can address personalized forces symbolically and expect them to respond. Maintaining contact with cosmic forces is complex, and societies have complex social practices designed to ensure that this is done properly. Two implrtant kinds of religious specialists are shamans and priests.
7. Many anthropologists have attempted to display the rich, coherent tapestries of symbols, rituals, and everyday practices that make up particular world views and to demonstrate the high degree to which world views vary from one another. They have also studied the ways in which drastic changes in people's experiences lead them to create new meanings to explain the changes and to cope with them. This can be accomplished through elaboration of the old system to fit changing times, conversion to a new world view, syncretism, revitalization, or resistance.
8. Because religious knowledge is not distributed evenly among the members of societies, those who control such knowledge are often able to use it as an instrument of power to control other members of society.
