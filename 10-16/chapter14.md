# What Can Anthropology Tell Us about Social Groups and Inequality?
Statified societies are societies made up of permanently ranked subgroups, in which the higher ranking groups have disproportionately greater access to wealth, power, and prestige than do lower ranking groups.

## What Are Naturalizing Discourses?
All of these categories are culturally and historically created. Some argue the opposite: that ehese categories have always been part of human society. Claims that consider social categories as eternal and unchanging, rather than the result of history or culture, have been called *naturalizaing discourses*

### Class
**Class** is a ranked group within a hierarchically stratified society whose membership is defined primarily in terms of wealth, occupation, or other economic criteria.

Class divisions did not wirhter away in Europe during the nineteenth century; they just changed their contours. 

Marx defines classes in terms of their members' different relations to the means of production. 

**Clientage** is the institution linking idividuals from upper and lower levels in a stratified sociery.

**Caste** is a ranked group within a hierarchically stratified society that is closed, prohibiting individuals from moving from one caste to another. 

*Race* was used both to explain human diversity and to justify the domination of Indigenous peoples and the enslavement of Africans.

It is important to emphasize once again that all the so-called races of human beings are *imagined communities*. The traditional concept of biological "race" in WEstern society is incoherent and biologically meaningless.

**Colourism** is a system of social identities negotiated situationally along a continuum of skin colours between white and black. 

**Ethnic groups** are social groups whose members distinguish themselves in terms of **ethnicity** - that is, in terms of distinctive cultural features, such as language, religion, or dress. Ethnicity, like race, is a culturally constructed concept. Ethnicity is created by historical processes that incorporate distinct social groups into a single political structure under conditions of inequality. 

*self-ascription*(insiders' efforts to define their own identity) and *other-ascription*(outsiders' efforts to define the identities of other groups).

*Objectification* refers to the intentional construction of a collective public identity; it is the process that produces "everyday" or "normal" ethnicity.

*Reification* is a form of negative racial or ethnic absolutism that encourages the violent elimination of targeted groups and is central to the practice of racism.

## How Do Anthropologists Study Human Rights?
### Are Human Rights Universal?
**Human rights** is powers, privileges, or material resources to which people everywhere, by virtue of being human, are justly entitled.

**Multiculturalism** is living permanently in settings surrounded by people with cultural backgrounds different from one's own and struggling to define with them the degree to which the cultural beliefs and practices of different groups should or should not be accorded respect and recognition by the wider society.

### Human Rights Discourse as the Global Language of Social Justice
Human rights discourses are common currency in all societies, at all levels.

What counrs as "human rights" has changed over time, not only because of the action of international bodies like the UN but also because of the efforts of an increasing number of NGOs that have become involved in various countries of the world, many of them deeply committed to projects designed to improve people's lives and protect their rights.

1. Human rights are opposed to culture
2. The idea that a key universal human right is precisely one's right to culture.

### Rights versus Culture
Arguments that pit human rights against culture depend on the assumption that "cultures" are homogeneous, bounded, and unchanging sets of ideas and practices and that each society has only one culture, which its members are obligated to follow.

### Rights to Culture
This argument does not view universal "human rights" as alien and opposed to "cultures". Instead, it says that all peoples have a universal human right to maintain their own distincy cultures.

The common understanding that people frequently cannot enjoy their full human rights until they are *freed* from the constraints of local cultures.

### Rights as Pars of Culture
The entire question of "legitmacy" in human rights discourse points to the central role played by law, both as a way of articulating specific human rights and as a tool for defending those rights.

### How Culture Can Help in Thinking about Rights
To use the culture concept as a tool for analyzing human rights processes means looking for "patterns and relationships of meaning and practice between different domains of social life" that are characteristic of the culture of human rights.

### The Relationship between Human Rights and Humanitarianism
National governments and international organizations have come to respond to asylum-seekers in recent decades.
Political asylum-seekers were increasingly lumped together with victims of earthquakes and tsunamis and addressed by a new form of governmentality

### Nationalism and Its Dangers
The most horrifying consequence of nation-building movements in the twentieth century has been the discovery of just how fare the ruling groups of some nation-states are willing to go in order to enforce their version of national identity.
## Chapter Summary
1. Because membership in social categories such as gender, class, caste, race, ethnicity, and nation can determine enormous differences in people's life chances, much is at stake in defending these categories and all may be described as if they were rooted in biology or nature, rather than culture and history. Conceptualizing these forms of identity as essences can be a way of stereotyping and excluding, but it has also been used by many stigmatized groups to build a positive self-image and as a strategic concept in struggles with dominant groups. Although strategic essentialism may be successful in such struggles, it also rissks repeating the same logic that justifies oppression. 
2. The concept of class in ahthropology has a double heritage: Europeans tended to view class boundaries as closed and rigid, whereas North Americans tended to view them as open and permeable. Class solidarity may be undercut by clientage relations that bind individuals to one another across class boundaries.
3. The stratification system of India has been taken as the prototype of caste stratification, although anthropologists also have applied the concept of caste to social hierarchies encountered elsewhere in the world. Local caste divisions in rural India adhere to rules of purity and pollution that are defined in terms of the occupations their members perform and the foods they eat and that govern whom they may marry. Members of jatis of similar rank do not observe most of these distinctions with one another, especially in urban settings. Caste associations in large cities of India use jati ties to promote their members' economic well-being. The use of violence by higher ranking jatis to block the advance of lower ranking jatis has increased in recent years. Contemporary anthropologists reject views of caste in India that portray it as internally harmonious and uncontested by those at the bottom of the hierarchy, pointing to the rise in caste violence in recent years.
4. The contemporary concept of "race" developed in the context of European exploration and conquest beginning in the fifteenth century as light-skinned Europeans came to rule over darker-skinned peoples in different parts of the world. The socalled races whose boundaries were forged during the nineteenth century are imagined communities; human biological variation does not naturally clump into separate populations with stable boundaries. Despite variations in opinions and practices regarding race over the centuries, a global hierarchy persists in which whiteness symbolizes high status and blackness symbolizes the social bottom.
5. Although ethnic consciousness existed in precolonial societies, contemporary anthropologiests have been most interested in forms of ethnicity that were generated under colonial domination, when different groups were subordinated within a single political structure under conditions of inequality. This process can produce ethnic groups not continuous with any single earlier group and is often characterized by nesting, opposed identities that individuals often manipulate in order to achieve upward mobility. When dominant ethnic groups feel threatened, they may attempt to stigmatize subordinate groups by "racializaing" them.
6. Discussions of human rights have intensified as global flows juxtapose and at least implicitly challenge different understandings of what it means to be human or what kinds of rights people may be entitled to under radically changed conditions of everyday life. But different participants in this discourse have different ideas about the relationship between human rights and culture. Some arguments about human rights include the right to one's culture. But most international human rights documents protect only individual human rights, not group rights. And even those who seek to protect their individual rights are supposed to appeal to the governments of their own nation-states to enforce rights defined in international documents.
7. Some anthropologists argue that a "culture of human rights" has emerged in recent years that is based on certain ideas about human beings, their needs, and their abilities that originated in the West. Some consider this culture of human rights the culture of a globalizing world that emphasizes individual rights over duties or needs and that proposes only technical rather than ethcal solutions to human suffering. Anthropologists disagree about the value of such a culture of human rights in contemporary circumstances.
8. Because human rights law recognizes only certain kinds of rights violations, groups with grievances must tailor those grievances to fit the violations that human rights law recognizes. Groups that enter into the human rights process are entering into ethnically ambiguous territory that is both enabling and constraining. Some anthropologists are concerned that a discouse of humanitarianism that responds to human suffering on compassionate grounds is pushing aside a discourse emphasizing human rights and social justice.
