# Why Do Anthropologists Study Economic Relations?
> Social Organization - The patterning of human interdependence in a given sociery through the actions and decisions of its members.

## How Do Anthropologists Study Economic Relations?
Our physical survival depends on our making adequate use of the resources around us, our culture tells us which resources to use and how to use them.

**Economic anthropology** is the part of discipline that debates issues of *human nature* that relate directly to the decisions of daily life and making a living

*Making a living* is the ways that people go about getting food resources.
* Food collectors
    * Depends on the richness of the environments in which they live.
* food producers
    * *Extensive agrivulturalists* or *horticulturalists* - Depend primarily on human power and simple tools.
    * *Intensive agrivulture* - Brings much more land under cultivation at any one time and procues significant crop surpluses.
    * *Mechanized industrial agriculture* - Farming has become organized along industrial lines

## How Do Anthropologists Study Production, Distribution, and Consumption?
Economic activity is sibdivided into three distinct phase
1. Production - Transforming nature's raw materials into products useful to human beings
2. Distribution - Getting those products to people
3. Consumption - Using up the products

Many would agree that patterns of production, exchange, and consumption are seriously affected by the kind of *storage* in use in a particular society.

## How Are Goods Distributed and Exchanged?
### Capitalism and Neoclassical Economics
**Capitalism** - An economic system dominated by the supoply-demand-price mechanism called the "market"; and entire way of life that grew in response to and inservice of that market.

Capitalist market exchange of goods for other goods, for labour, or for cash.

**Neoclassical economics** - A formal attempt to explain the workings of capitalist enterprise, with particular attentiont to distribution.

### Self-Interest, Institutions, and Morals
It is possible to identify three theoretical camps in economic anthropology
1. *self-interested model* - Human nature originated during the Enlightenment and is based on the assumption that individuals are fist and foremost interested in their own well-being, that selfishness is natural.
2. *Institutions* - Complex, variable, and enduring forms of cultural practices that organize social life. People identify with the groups to which they belong.
3. *Moral model* - People's motivations are shaped by culturally specific belief systems and values guided by a culturally patterend view of the universe. People are socialized and enculturated into these values and practices over a lifetime, such that they will experience distress and conflict if tempted to make decisions that are contrary to their internalized morality.

### Modes of Exchange
Some anthropologists argues that taking self-interested, materialistic decision making in the capitalist market as the prototype of human rationality was ethnocentric.

> **Gift** - A good or service exchanged as part of social relations.
> **gift exchanges** - Non-capitalist forms of economic exchange that are deeply embedded in social relations and always require a return gift.
> **commodity exchanges** - Impersonal economic exchanges typical of the capitalist market in which goos are exchanged for cash and exchange partners need have nothing further to do with one another.
> **commodities** - Goods exchanged for cash
> **modes of exchange** - Patterns according to which distribution takes place: reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange.


Marcel Mauss contrasted non-capitalist **gift exchanges** with impersonal **commodity exchanges** typical of the capitalist market.

**Modes of exchange**
1. Reciprocity - characteristic of an egalitarian society
    1. _Generalized reciprocity_ - Those who exchange do so without expecting an immediatereturn and without specifying the value of the return.
        1. *Complementary* - Each make distinct contributions.
        2. *Asymmetrical* - Exchange asymmetrically.
        3. *Symmetrical* - Exchange symmetrically.
    2. _Balancewd reciprocity_ - Those who exchange expect a return of equal value within a specified time limit.
    3. _Negative reciprocity_ - an exchange of goods and services in which at least one party attempts to get somethign for nothign without suffering any penalties
2. Redistribution - A mode of exchange that requires some form of centralized social organization to receive economic contributions from all members of the group and to redistribute them in such a way as to provide for every group member.
3. Market exchange - Invented in capitalist society, is the most recent mode of exchange. The exchange of goods calculated in terms of a multipurpose medium of exchange and standard of value and carried out by means of a supply-demand-price mechanism.

## Does Production Drive Economic Activities?
Some argued that production is the triving force behind economic activity, creating supplies of good that must accommodate people's demand., thereby determining levels of consumption.

### Labour 
**Labour** - The activity linking human social groups to the material world around them; from the point of view of Karl Marx, labour is, therefore, always social abour.

### Modes of Production
**Mode of production** - The way that labour is organized within a society using specific tools, skills, organizaiton, and knowledge.

**Means of production** - The tools, skills, organization, and knowledge used to make a living.

**Relations of production** The social relations linking the poeple who use a given means or production within a particular mode of production. 

Three modes of production
1. *Kin-ordered mode* - Social labour is deployed on the basis of kinship relations. The *relations of kinship* serve as the *relations of production* that enable a particular *mode of production*.
2. *Tributary mode* - Primary producer, whether cultivator or herdsman, is allowed access to the means of production while tribute is exacted from him by political or military means.
3. *Capitalist mode* - The means of production are private property owned by members of the capitalist class, workers must sell their labour power to the capitalists in order to survive, and surpluses of wealth are produced that capitalists may retain as profit or reinvest in production to increase output and generate further surpluses and higher profits.

### The Role of Conflict in Material Life
Some argues that social stability was "natural" and should not be tmpered with. Social change was possible, but it would take place in an orderly fashion, in the fullness of time, according to laws of development beyond the control of individual members of society.

Many anthropologists, however, have not been persuagded that social organization is naturally harmonious or that social change is naturally orderly. Instead, they tend to use marxian approaches because these sorts of approaches recognize that conflict and disorder are a natural part of the human condition.

## Why Do People Consume What They Do?
**Comsumption** usually refers to the use of material goods necessary for human survival. Studying consumption seemed unlinkely to reveal any interesting cultural patterns. Anthropologists have taken three basic approaches to account for these patterns
1. The Internal Explanation - Basic human needs (nourishment, reproduction, bodily comforts)
2. The External Explanation - People depend on the particular external resources present in the local habitat to which their mambers must adapt.
3. The Cultural Explanation

### The Original Affluent Society
**Affluence** - The condition fo having more than enough of whatever is required to satisfy consumption needs.
1. *product much* - The path taken by Western capitalist societies
2. *derise little*

### How Consumption Is Being Studied Today
In a global world in whih everyone everywhere increasingly relies on commodities provide by a capitalist market, one must consider how unsustailable this system is as the population of the world continues to grow.

## The Anthropology of Food
*mezzadria* - The patriarch managed food production in the fields, and his wife supervised food preparation for the large extended family.

## Chapter Summary
1. Contemporary cultural and economic anthropologists are interested in how cultures change, but they are suspicious of evolutionary schemes that give the impression that social arrangements could not have been-or could not be--other than the way they are. They also point out that no society anywhere is static. The power that human beings have to reproduce or to change their social organization is an important focus of anthropological study. Anthropological approaches can provide insights often overlooked by other disciplines.
2. Human economic activity is usefully divided into three phases-production, distribution, and consumption-and is often shaped in important ways by storage practices. Formal neoclassical economic theory developed in Europe to explain how capitalism works, and it emphasized the importance of market exchange, Economic anthropologists have shown that non-capitalist cosieties regularly relied on non-market modes of exchange, such as reciprocity and redistribution, which still play restricted roles in societies dominated by the capitalist market.
3. Marxian economic anthropologists view production as more important than exchange in etermining the patterns of economic life in a society. They classify societies in terms of their modes of production. Each mode of production contains within it the potential for conflich between classes of people who receive differential benefits and losses from the productive process.
4. In the past, some anthropologists tried to explain consumtion patterns in different societies either by arguing that people produce material goods to satisfy basic human needs or by connecting consumption patterns to specific material resources available to people in the material settings where they lived. Ethnographic evidence demonstrates that both these explanations are inadepquiate because they ignore how culture defines our needs and provides for their satisfaction according to its own logic.
5. Particular consumption preferences that may seem irrational from the viewpoint of neoclassical economic theory may make sense when the wider cultural practices of consumers are taken into consideration. In the twenty-first centyury, those whom Western observers might have expected to reject Western market commodites often embrace them, frequently making use of them to defend or enrich their local culture rather than to replace it. In a global world in which everyone everywhere increasinglyu relies on commodities-including food-provided by a capitalist market, some anthropologists focus on inequalities of access and the negative impact of contemporary economic institutions on most of the world's population.
