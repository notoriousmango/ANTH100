# What Can Anthropology Teach Us about Sex, Gender, and Sexuality?

## How Did Twentieth-Century Feminism Shape the Anthropological Study of Sex, Gender, and Sexuality?
**Feminism** argues that women and men are equally human and therefore that women are entitled to enjoy the same rights and privileges as men.

First wave of feminism in the nineteenth century - right to vote

Second wave of feminism in the 1960-70 - Many domains of social life continued to be organized in terms of **patriarchy** - that is, by the domination of men over women and children.

Feminists conined the term **sexism** to describe the systematic sociocultural structures and practices of inequality, derived from partichal institutions, that continue to shape relations between women and men.

Achieving full equality between women and men was understood to require not only changing beliefs but also dismantling partiarchal institutions and practices.

A rallying cry for many second-wave feminists was that "the personal is political". These feminists confronted the **public/private divide**, a barrier that law and custom had erected between "private" domestic life in the family, conceived as "women's place", and public life, outside that family, conceived as the domain of men.

*Sex* refers to the physical characteristics that distinguish males from females. *Gender* refers to the culturally constructed roles assigned to males or females.

**Gender binary** is a dual gender categorization separationg all women form all men.

**Androgyny** is a condition in which an individual person possesses both male and female characteristics.
## How Do Anthropologists Organize the Study of Sex, Gender, and Sexuality?
**Men's studies/masculinities** is a research that focuses on the many different ways of being a man that can be identified in different places and time.

Individuals' composite gender itendity incorporates many features shaped by the historical, economic, political, and sociocultural settings in which they live their lives.
## How Are Sex and Gender Affected by Other Forms of Identity?
As feminist scholars struggled to debunk supposedly universal "truths" about women, they came to realize that "women" itself is a problematic category.

**Intersectionality** is the notion that institutional forms of oppression organized in terms of race, class, and gender are interconnected and shape the opportunities and constraints available to individuals in any society.
## How Do Ethnographers Study Gender Performativity?
It is misleading to think of culturally expected gender "roles" simply as obligations to which individuals learned to *confirm*. Instead, these roles looked more like scripts that individuals learned to *perform*; and part of which identities to highlight or downplay in any given social interaction.

Understanding cultural identity as something people perform compels anthropologists to think of individuals as *agents* who have mastered a range of skills that are appropriate for the public display of particular identities before particular audiences.

**Gender performativity** is the concept that gender is comething we "perform" or "enact," something we "learn to do," not somethign we "are born with."

**Transvestism** is the practice of dressing as and taking on mannerism associated with a gender other than one's own

## How Do Anthropologists Study Connections among Sex, Gender, Sexuality, and the Body?
An importasnt trend in sociocultural anthropology in recent decades has been attention to "the body", an object of study that is of obvious relevance to discussions of sex, gender, and sexuality. To understand the growth of interest in the body,m remember that, for most of the twentieth century, sociocultural anthropology consistently downplayed human indiividuals and instead highlighted patterns that characterized the social groups to which individual humans belonged. In recent years, anthropologists acts on individual bodies.

Anthropologists have traditionally understood that human beings are plastic organisms whoare open to the moulding processes of socialization and enculturation. This resonated with Foucault's understanding of the human body as a *docile* body; that is, a body that is easily taught, or, in Foucault's terms, a body "that may be subjected, used, transformed, and improved" through "disciplinary methods" that apply "an uniterrupted, constant coercion" of bodily activities, making possible "the meticulous control of the operations of the body".

Conceiving of huuman bodies as nothing more than passive, inert matter is problematic Theorists in anthropology have drawn attention to the ways in which **affect**(visceral arousal, emotion, or feeling) is not opposed to rational thought but is in fact entwined with thought in processes of making meaning in human lives 

### Connections between Bodies and Technologies
Connections between humans and machines in contemporary societies can be found everywhere today, from computerized management of large informational databases in government and private industry, to online computer gaming, to your personal relationship with your smartphone.

## How Do Anthropologists Study Relations between Sex, Gender, and Sexuality?
As we saw earlier, at one time, anthropologists agreed that "sex," while distinct from culturally shaped "gender," was a "natural" physical attribute clearly visible on the body, to be determined by inspection at birth or at puberty. However, this way of classifying bodies, based on the presumption of a "natural" gender binary, turns out to be problematic.

Individuals who possess ambiguous genitalia have called *intersex*, although many prefer to describe their condition as the result of a *disorder of sexual development*.

Minimally, *sexuality* refers to the ways in which people experience and value physical desire and plesure in the context of sexual intercourse.

**Heterosexuality** is sexual relations involving individuals of different sexualities. **heteronormativity** is the view that heterosexual intercourse is the "normal" form that human sexual expression always takes.

**Heterosexism** is a form of bias against all those who are not heterisexual. **Homosexuality** is sexual relations involving two males or two females.

**Gay** ia an affirmative and empowering self-designation for individuals medically classified as homosexual, which became widespread over the couse of the twentieth century. **Lesbian** is a term used to describe female same-sex sexuality around the turn of the twentieth century; based on the name of hte Greek island of Lesbos, the home of the female poet Sappho, who was reputed to love women rather than men.

**Bisexuality** is sexual attraction to both males and females. **Transgender** is a term proposed in the 1960s by medical researchers to classify indicuals who, in one way or another, seemed dissatisfied with the sex and gender assignments they had received at birth. **Panesxuality** is sexual attraction to males, females, and transgender males and females.

**Queer** is a self-identification claimed by some persons whose gender identities or sexual practices fall outside the range defined by "the heterosexual-homosexual continuum." **non-binary** is self-identification that resists the gender binary, embodying the fluidity of gender as a cosial consturuct.

## How Does Ethnography Document Variable Cultural Understandings Concerning Sex, Gender, and Sexuality?
*berdache* had been used by anthropologists to refer to Indigenous social roles in which men were allowed to take on the activities and some-times the dress of members of the other sex. Today, many anthropologists refuse to use the term, as do many contemporary members of Indigenous societies. Rather, the more respectful term *two spirited* is used by individuals who view themselves as modern embodiments of these alternative-geneer roles.

## Chapter Summary
1. Cultural anthropologists have been interested in sex, gender, and sexuality since the beginnings of anthropology as a discipline and, since the 1930s, have insisted that biological sex needs to be distinguished from cultural rules for appropriate behaviour as a female or a male.Twentieth-century social movements for civil rights, women's rights, and the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons called into question the existence of a universal sex and gender binary in all human societies. Some anthropologists argues that sexist patterns in contemporary societies, in the West and elsewhere, were due primarily to the effects of capitalism and colonialism on Indigenous societies that had once supported more egalitarian relationships between men and women. Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern provided ethnographic evidence suggeting that Melanesian peoples tended to view males and females as androgynous. These efforts combined with work by scholars in other disciplines to produce an overall rethinking of how sex, gender, and sexuality ought to be understood.
2. The influence of feminism on anthropology initially led to a focus on the roles women played in different societies, but before long it became clear that women's roles could not be studied apart from the foles of men. Increasing attention to the ways sex,gender, and sexuality are differently enacted in different times and places led to a recognition that masculinities and femininities might be constructed in more than one way, even in a single sociery. Some anthropologists have used ethnographic data to demonstrate the processes by which new kinds of masculinity can develop over time, as new generations of men in particular societies confront challenges and opportunities that differ from earlier generations, as seen in Marcia Inhorn's discussion of emerging masculinities in the Middle East. Changes in masculinities also emerge over the life cycle, and Emily Wentzell's discussion of composite masculinities illuminates the process whereby Mexican men delete old elements and add new elements of their masculine identities as they come to terms with the challenges of aging and illness.
3. Women of colour developed approcahes to sex, gender, and sexuality that went beyond the views of feminists who took the experiences of white middle-class Euro-American women as the norm, showing how experiences of gender oppression always intersected with other social statuses, such as race and social class. Ethnographers have identified patterns of intersectionality in their fieldwork and are able to provide comparative examples from different times and places.
4. Scholars and activists for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender rights developed approaches that showed why gender roles were best understood as performances in which individuals attempted to enact forms of speech and behaviour that were considered appropriate in their societies. This made room for individual agency and for recognition that human affect could not be completely contained within any particular set of socially established definitions of sex, gender, or sexuality. The malleability of the human body, shaped by the skills we all learn that enable us to mimic others whose gender or sexuality differs from our own, highlights a range of performance possibilities of gender and sexuality that, as Roger Lancaster argues, can deepn our understanding of what may count as "trannsvestism."
5. Work in the anthropology of science, technology, and medicine has drawn attentiont o the ways that humans are incresingly linked to, and dependent on, technologies. These arangements can be seen in cases of cutting-edge medical technologies that allow infertile couples to produce biological offspring, as shown in Marcia Inhorn's research in the Middle East. But the connection between biology and technology in the production of human bodies that conform to a society's gender binary by means of surgery and hormones also demonstrates a similar kind of connection between biology and technology. Anthropologists and biologists have drawn attention to the high proportion of human infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. In the United States, beginning in the 1960s, such infants were assigned a sex by physicians and parents, and surger, hormone treatments, and other forms of therapy were used to bring such persons into alignment with the American gender binary, Such interventions have become controversial as adults who ere subjected to these interventions as infants have grown up and protested what was done to them. Roger Lancaster persuasively argues that these surgically and hormonally mediated forms of anatomical reshaping may be usefully understood as a "transvestics of the body."
6. Scholars inside and outside anthropology have contributed to attempts to categorize the many categories of sex, gender, and sexuality that people have recognized in different times and places. Historians have provided useful information about the origins of the technical terms relating to sex, gender, and sexuality that are used today by Euro0American scholars and activists, which are briefly summarized in shit chapter. The pproliferation of distinct labels over time usggests to seome observaers that not only is there no gender biunary but that it makes more sense to describe variation in sex, gender, and sexuality in terms of points on a coninuum or in terms of gender fluidity.
7. In the context of globalization in the twenty-first century, Euro-American ideas about sex, gender, and sexuality have spread to many parts of the world that traditionally have thought about these phenomena in different ways. Sometimes Euro0American categories mix uneasily with local categories, even as those local understandings themselves challenge tranditional Western heteronormative assumptions. Ethnographic studies of sex, gender, and sexuality from Kenya and Iran illustrate these kinds of variation and complication.
