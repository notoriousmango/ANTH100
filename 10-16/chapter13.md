# How Do Anthropologists Study Political Relations?

> **Power** is a transformative capacity; the ability to transform a given situation.

When anthropologists study those that possess power, they consider how those who have power have the ability to transform a given situation.

Three different modes of social power:
1. *Interpersonal power* or *persuation* involves the ability of one individual to impose his or her will on another individual
2. *Organization* or *authoritative power* highlights how individuals or social units can limit the actions of other individuals in particular social settings.
3. *Structural power* organizes social settings themselves and controls the allocation of social labour.

## How Are Culture and Politics Related?
**Political anthropology** is a study of social power in human society. There is four types of preindustrial political systems
|Category              | Description | Exmample |
|----------------------|-------------|----------|
|Band/Egalitarian      | A small, predominantly foraging society of 50 or fewer members that divides labour by age and sex only and provides relatively equal access for all adults to wealth, power, and prestige | Ju/'hoansi of South Africa|
|Tribe/Ranked|A farming or herding society, usually larger than a band, that relies on kinship as the framework for social and political life; provides relatively egalitarian social relations buut may have a leader who has more prestige(but not more power or wealth) than others. Sometimes called a *rank society*|Hmong of Southeast Asia|
|Chiefdom/Stratified|Asocially stratified society, generally larger than a tribe, in which a chief and close relatives enjoy privileged access to wealth, power, and prestige; has greater craft production but few full-time specialists.|Trobriand Islanders of the South Pacific|
|State|Aneconomic, political, and ideological entity invented by stratified societies; possesses specialized government institutions to administer services and collect taxes and tribute; monopolizes use of force with armies and police; possesses high level and quality of craft production. Oftern has developed writing(particularly in early states).|Canada
|Empire|Forms when one state conquers another|Roman Empire|

1. bands
2. tribes
3. chiefdoms
4. states

*Unilineal cultural evolutionism* is one-way progression of human political organization, from band to state.

The *chiefdom* is the first human social form to show evidence of permanent inequalities of wealth and power, in addition to inequality of **Status**. Status is a particular social position in a group.

The **state** is a stratified society that possesses a territory that is defended from outside enemies with an army and from internal disorder with police. A state, which has a separate set of governmental institutions designed to enforce laws and to collect taxes and tribute, is run by an elite that possesses a monopoly on the use of force.

Human beings actively work to reshape the environments in which they live to suit themselves. Because the resources available in any environment can be used to sustain more than one way of life, however, human beings must choose which aspects of the material world to depend on. This is why, inevitably, questions about human population growth and economic activity are intimately interwined with questions about the distribution of power in society.

## How Do Anthropologists Study Politics?
### Coercion
For some anthropologists, the absence of a state could mean only *anarchy*: disorderly struggles for power among individuals. This view assumes that power is best understood as physical force, or *coercion*. Their assumption was that co-operative social living is not natiral for human individuals because they are born with **free agency** - instincts that lead them to pursue their own self-interest above everything else and to challenge one another for dominance.

### Is Political Power Nothing More Than Coercion?
Witchcraft is an Organizational power that does not depend on state coercion. Instead, it depends on *persuation*.

### How Do Anthropologists Study Resistance to Coercion?
The framework of analysis in which such accounts are located is dualistic: rulers monopolize power, and those who are ruled struggle against that monopoly in order to wrest power away from the rulers.
**Hidden transcripts** is a private accounts by dominated groups of their oppression and alternative to it developed outside the public political arena. These hidden accounts contrast with the views dominated peoples express in public political contexts that do not challenge the legitimacy of the dominant political order. The existence of hidden transcripts shows that even though these transcripts do not change their lived reality, the poor peasants are using them to recreate their lived experiences with meanings of their own choosing.

### Are There Limitations to Analyzing Power in Terms of Domination and Resistance?
Cultural understandings could play a role not only in consolidating power from above but also in resisting domination from below. Two key concepts: **Domination** and **Hegemony**.

### What Are Domination and Hegemony?
A world view that justifies the social arrangements under which people live is sometimes called an **ideology**. Karl Marx argued that rulers consolidate their power by successfully persuading their subjects to accept an ideology that portrays domination by the ruling class as legitimate; dominated groups who accept the ruling class ideology were said to suffer from *false consciousness*.

**Domination** is expensive and unstable.

**Hegemony** is the persuation of subordinates to accept the ideology of the dominant group by mutual accommodations that nevertheless preserve the ruler's privileged position. It may be threatened if subordinate groups maintain or develop alternative, or *counterhegemonic, cultural practices.

### Biopower and Governmentality
**Biopower** is a forms of power preoccupied with bodies, both the bodies of citizens and the social bodyt of the state itself. Biopolitics, using statistics to inform their political policies.

**Governmentality** involves using the information encoded in statistics to govern in a way that promotes the welfare of populations within a state.


## How Do Anthropologists Study Politics of the Nation-State?
**Nations**: groups of people believed to share the same history, culture, language, and even the same physical substance. **Nation-state** is an ideal political unit in which national identity and political territory coincide.

**Nationality** is a sense of identification with and loyalty to a nation-state.

**Transformist hegemony** is a nationalist program to define nationality in a way that preserves the cultural domination of the ruling group while including enough cultural features from subordinated groups to ensure their loyalty.

### Globalization and the Nation-State
Ongoing changes in the world have begun to challenge the territorial boundaries that nation-states have struggled to erect around themselves. Processes of globalization and manufacturing have unleashed flows of wealth, images, people, things, and ideologies across the world. The pressures of these global flows on the boundaries of nation-states have been profound. 

Migrants and refugees themselves often face a dilemma. On the one hand, they now form sizable and highly visible minorities in tthe countries of settlement, often in the poorer areas of cities. There they find oppotunities for economic subsistence and political security, encouraging them to stay. On the other hand, hostility and sometimes violence are directed against them whenever there is a local economic downturn.

### Migration, Trans-Border Identities, and Long-Distance Nationalism
The term *diaspora* is commonly used to refer to migrant populations with a shared identity who live in a variety of different locales around the world. 

**Long-distance nationalism** is a members of a diaspora organized in support of nationalist struggles in their homeland or to agitate for a state of their own.

**Trans-border state** is a form of state in which it is claimed that those people who left the country and their descendatns remain part of their ancestral state, even if they are citizens of another state.

**Trans-border citizenry** is a group made up of citizens of a country who continue to live in their homeland plus the people who have emigrated from the couuntry and their descendants, regardless of their current citizenship.

**Legan citizenship** is the rights and obligations of citizenship accorded by the laws of a state.

**Substantive citizenship** is the actions people take, regardless of their legal citizenship status, to assert their membership in a state and to bring about political changes that will improve their lives.

**Transnational nation-state** is a nation-state in which the relationships between citizens and the state extend to whereever citizens reside.

## What Happens to Citizenship in a Globalized World?
**Flexible citizenship** is the strategies and effects employed by managers, technocrats, and professionals who move regularly across state boundaries and who seek both to circumvent and benefit from different nation-state regimes.

**Postnational ethos** is an attitude toward the world in which people submit to the governmentality of the capitalist market while trying to evade the governmentality of nation-states.

## Global Politics in the Twenty-First Century
National boundaries have softened. In some cases, bnation-states have given up claimes to sovereignty over some of their citizens, but some of these same citizens, now moving in the same globalized contexts, have found new ways of asserting their own territorial citizenship

## Chapter Summary
1. Contemporary cultural anthropologists are interested in how cultures change, but they are suspicious of evolutionary schemes that give the impression that social arrangements could not have been-or could not be- other than the way they are. They also point out that no sociery anywere is static. The power that human beings have to reproduce or to change their social organizaiton is an important focus of political anthropology.
2. The ability to act implies power. The study of power in human society is the domain of political anthropology. In most societies at most times, power cannot be reduced to physical force, although this is the Western prototype of power. Power in society opwerates according to principles that are cultural creations. As such, those principles are affected by history and may differ from on esociety to another.
3. Western thinkers traditionally assumed that without a state, social life would be chaotic, if nor impossible. They belived that people were free agents who would not co-operate unless forced to do so. Anthropologists have demonstrated that power is exercised both by coercive and by persuasive means. They have been influenced by the works of Antonio Gramsci and Michel Foucault. Gramsci argued that coercion alone is rarely sufficient for social control, distinguishing coercive domination from hegemony. Rulers always face the risk that those they dominate may create counterhegemonic accounts of their experience of being dominated, acquire a following, and unseat their rulers. Foucault's developed in Western nation-states in the nineteenth century that aimed to create and sustain peaceful and prosperous social life by exercising biopower over persons who could be counted, whose physical attributes could be measured statistically, and whose sexual and reproductive behaviours could be shaped by the exercise of state power.
4. Nation-states were invented in nineteenth-century Europe, but they have spread throughout the world along with capitalism, colonialism, and eventual political decolonization. Nationalist thinking aims to create a political unit in which national identity and political territory coincide, and this has led to various practices designed to force subordinate social groups to adopt a national identity defined primarily in terms of the culture of the dominant group. When subordinate groups resist, they maybecome the victims of genocide or ethnic cleansing. Alternatively, the dominant group may try to recast its understanding of national identity in a way that acknowledges and incorporates cultural elements belonging to subordinate groups. If the creation of such an imagined hybrid indentity is not accompanied by legal and political changes that support it, however, the end result may be political turmoil, as shown in the recent history of Fiji.
5. The flows unleashed by globalization have undermined the ability of nation-states to police their boundaries effectively. Contemporary migrants across national borders have developed a variety of trans-border identities. Some become involved in long-distance nationalism that leads to the emergence of trans-border states claiming emigrants as trans-border citizens of their ancestral homelands even if they are legal citizens of another state. Some trans-border citizenries call for the establishment of full-fledged transnational nation-states. Struggles of these kinds can be found all over the globe, including in the contemporary states of the Europe Union.
6. The contrasts between formal and substantive citizenship suggest that conventional notions of citizenship are breaking down in the context of globalization. Diaspora communities of elite Chinese families have developed a strategy of flexible citizenship that allows them to both circumvent and benefit from different nation-state regimes. They seem to subscribe to a postnaitonal ethos in which their only true loyalty is to the family business.
