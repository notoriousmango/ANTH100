# What Can Evolutionary Theory Tell Us about Human Variation?
> **Microevoluition** is a subfield of evolutionary studies that devotes attention to short-term evolutionary changes that occur within a given species over relatively few generations of ecological time.

## What Is Microevolution?
### The Modern Evolutionary Synthesis and Its Legacy
Biologists and geeticists worked to formulate a new way of thinking about evolution taht combined Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian idea s about heredity. Until recently this approach dominated research and thinking in biology. 

The most significant contribution of neo-Darwinism was the way it undermined the nineteenth-century anthropological misconception of "biological race", refocusing attention on a new understanding of biological species.

Field biologists use the following definition of *species*: a reproductive community of a population, isolated from others, that occupies a specific niche in nature. However, this definition has been less useful for scientists studying fossils.

Species normally are subdivided into *populations* that are more or less scattered, altough the separation is not complete.That is, populations of the same species may be separated at one time but may merge together again, and successfully reproduce, at a later time. 
**Reticulation** takes place within a species and that the "resulting web-like pattern of relationships is very different from the dichotomous pattern among species" on which the phylogenetic species concept is based.

Darwinian population thinking requires biologists to recognize the distinctiveness of each individual *organism* that belongs to a particular population of a given species.

Neo-Darwinians were also concerned about the genetic makeup of species. They introduced the concept of the **gene pool**, which includes all of the genes in the bodies of all member of a given species.

Using maehematical models, evolutionary theorists can estimate the **gene frequency** of particular genes-that is, the frequency of occurrence of gene variants or alleles within a particular gene pool. 

Mesarusing thae stability or change of gene frequencies in populations over time allowed geneticists to trace short-term evolutionary change, in a new field called **population genetics**.Once population geneticists had identified a target population, they analyzed its gene pool by calculating the frequencies of various alleles within that gene pool and trying to figure out what would happen to those frequencies if the carriers of the various alleles were subjected to aprticular selection pressures.

**Polymorphous** describes alleles that come in a range of different forms. Known polymorphous variants fall into one of two groups.
1. The first group, polymorphic alleles, accounts for most genetic variation across populations. Populations differe not because they have mutually exclusive sets of alleles but because they possess different *proportions* of the same set of alleles. ABO blood groups are found in all human populations, but the frequency of each allele differs from population to population. 
2. The second group, privaate polymorphisms, includes alleles that are found in the genotypes of some, but usually not all, members of a particular population.

There is not a simple line that can be drawn to distinguish groups of humans based on their genetic makeup. Himankind is not dicided into a series of genetically distinct units.

Genetic variation in human populations is mostly a matter of differences in the relative proportions of the same set of alleles.  The distributions of some traits do not match the distributions of other traits. **Cline** is sort of gradual intergradation of genetic variation from population to population.

### The Molecularization of Race?
There was no biological basis for race; in other words, all humans are part of a single species. Although there is internal variation within the species, it does not easily fall into the cultural categories of "race" as they had been defined. 

Human Genone Project has goals
* To identify all the approximately 20,500 genes in human DNA
* To determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA
* To store this information in databases
* To improve tools for data analysis

The old race concept focused on the classification of phenotypes, whereas the new race concept classifies genotypes. Nineteenth-century ace science aimes to discover how many races existed and to assign all individuals to their true race.
